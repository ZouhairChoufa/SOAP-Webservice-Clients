# JSP Web Client for Library SOAP Service

This project is a web-based client built with JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Servlets to interact with the Library SOAP Web Service. It provides a user interface in the browser to perform all the CRUD operations on the library's book collection. The user interface is styled with Bootstrap.

## Features

* A single web page (`index.jsp`) to view all books from the library.
* Forms to **add**, **update**, and **delete** books.
* Search functionality to find books by **ISBN** or by **author**.
* A central servlet (`BookServlet.java`) handles all backend logic.

## Technologies Used

* **JavaServer Pages (JSP)** & **Java Servlets** for the web application logic.
* **JAX-WS** for generating client stubs and communicating with the SOAP service.
* **Apache Tomcat** as the web server to run the application.
* **Maven** to manage dependencies and build the project.
* **Bootstrap 5** for styling the front-end.

## Prerequisites

1.  Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
2.  Apache Maven.
3.  An Apache Tomcat server (version 9 or higher) installed.
4.  The **SOAP-Server** project must be running so the WSDL is accessible.

## How to Run the Application

1.  **Start the SOAP Server**: Make sure your `SOAP-Server` application is running first.

2.  **Build the Project**: Open a terminal in the `SOAP-Client-JSP` directory and run the Maven build command. This will create a `.war` file (e.g., `SOAP-Client-JSP-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war`) in the `target/` directory.
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3.  **Deploy to Tomcat**:
    * Copy the generated `.war` file from the `target/` folder.
    * Paste it into the `webapps` directory of your Apache Tomcat installation.

4.  **Start Tomcat**: Start your Tomcat server. It will automatically deploy the application.

5.  **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and go to the application's URL. It will typically be:
    ```
    http://localhost:8080/SOAP-Client-JSP-1.0-SNAPSHOT/
    ```
    *(Note: The final part of the URL depends on the exact name of the `.war` file generated by Maven.)*
